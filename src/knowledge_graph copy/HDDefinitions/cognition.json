    "role_in_manifestation": "Existence as Vibration and Flow: Cognition tunes you to subtle vibrational cues in your environment, what smells, looks, or feels aligned, so you follow resonance rather than force. Tuning Over Forcing: Acting on your super-sense feels effortless; it prevents distortion by anchoring choices in what \u201cresonates true.\u201d Nonlinear Causality: Your primary sense often delivers nonverbal downloads of possibilities before they materialize. The Directive: Use your strongest sense as an instrument of alignment, attune to its signals, then allow manifestation to unfold.",
