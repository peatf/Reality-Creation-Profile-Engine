# Python Package Installation Issue Summary

**Package:** `flatlib` (version 0.2.3)
**Dependency Causing Failure:** `pyswisseph` (version 2.08.00-1, required by `flatlib`)
**Environment:** macOS (likely Apple Silicon/ARM), Python 3.12, Xcode Command Line Tools installed.
**Installation Method:** `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt` (or `pip install flatlib`)

**Problem:**
The installation of `flatlib` fails during the build process for its dependency, `pyswisseph==2.08.00-1`.

**Error Message:**
The C compilation fails with errors indicating incompatibility with the Python C API, specifically:
`error: call to undeclared function 'PyUnicode_AS_DATA'`

**Analysis:**
This error strongly suggests that the C code within the older `pyswisseph 2.08.00-1` version uses functions (like `PyUnicode_AS_DATA`) that are deprecated or have been removed/changed in modern Python versions (specifically Python 3.12 being used). This prevents the C extension from compiling successfully in this environment. Attempts to use older Python versions (3.11, 3.10) within Docker also failed, although the `docker` command itself was not found in the user's environment, preventing confirmation via Docker. Installing local build tools (Xcode Command Line Tools) did not resolve the local compilation error.

**Constraints:**
*   Using the *latest* version of `pyswisseph` directly is not the preferred solution due to potential commercial licensing costs associated with the underlying Swiss Ephemeris library it wraps.
*   Using Docker to create an older, potentially compatible Python environment is currently not feasible due to issues running the `docker` command.

**Question for Research/Help:**
Is there a known workaround, patch, or specific build flag required to successfully compile `pyswisseph==2.08.00-1` on macOS (ARM) with Python 3.12? Or is this combination fundamentally incompatible, necessitating the use of an alternative astrology library that avoids this specific dependency version?
