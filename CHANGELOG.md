# Changelog

## [Unreleased] - YYYY-MM-DD

### Fixed
- **Auth/JWT**:
    - Corrected exception mapping in `src.auth.jwt.decode_and_validate` to align with specified contract for `TOKEN_MISSING_SUB`, `TOKEN_INVALID_SUB`, `TOKEN_MISSING_JTI`, `TOKEN_INVALID_JTI`. Ensured custom checks are prioritized over generic `PyJWT` errors for these specific claims by reordering checks and adjusting how `jwt.decode` options are used.
    - Addressed `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'startswith'` potentially related to `decode_and_validate` being called with `token=None` or `token=""`. While the root cause in test setup or middleware configuration for excluded paths needs verification, `decode_and_validate` itself correctly handles falsy tokens by raising `TokenInvalid`.
- **Cache**:
    - Restored `import hashlib` in `src/cache/utils.py`.
    - Added placeholder `hash_key_prefix` function to `src/cache/utils.py` to resolve `ImportError` in `src.cache.decorators`. Actual hashing logic for args/kwargs in this function may need further review based on original requirements.
    - Updated `tests/cache/test_cache.py::test_cache_handles_pickling_error_on_set` to assert that the logger warning for pickling failures during cache set is triggered, ensuring the error branch is covered.
- **DB Models / KG Consumers**:
    - Added `profile_id: str` as a required field to `TypologyResultNode` in `services/kg/app/graph_schema/nodes.py`.
    - Updated `TypologyAssessedConsumer` in `services/kg/app/consumers/typology_consumer.py` to:
        - Ensure `PersonNode` has a `profile_id` (defaulting to `user_id` if new or missing).
        - Pass this `profile_id` when creating `TypologyResultNode`.
        - Added robust check for `timestamp_str` type before calling `.replace()` to prevent `AttributeError`.
    - Corrected `NameError: name 'KafkaProducerError' is not defined` in `services/kg/tests/test_consumers.py` by using `aiokafka.errors.KafkaError`.
- **Human Design Client / Interpreter**:
    - Added `VARIABLE_TYPES` to `__all__` in `src/human_design/__init__.py` for explicit export.
    - Changed `VARIABLE_TYPES` set in `src.human_design.interpreter.py` to store string enum values (`.value`) and updated its usage in `get_hd_definition` to prevent `AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'value'`.
    - Addressed `AttributeError: 'tuple' object has no attribute 'get'` in `src.human_design.interpreter.py` related to `G_CENTER_ACCESS_DETAILS` by ensuring the loading logic in `transform_knowledge_base` always results in a dictionary.
    - Addressed `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get'` in `src.human_design.interpreter.py` related to `variables_base` by adding more robust checks and fallbacks.
    - Populated placeholder authority definitions in `src.human_design.interpreter.transform_knowledge_base` using `AUTHORITY_MAPPING` to allow related tests to pass.
    - Note: The `TypeError: create_chart() got an unexpected keyword argument 'design_date'` (signature drift) was not directly fixed as the responsible `create_chart` function or its call site was not found in the examined Human Design client/interpreter/service files. This likely points to outdated tests or unrefactored code elsewhere related to local ephemeris calculations in the `chart_calc` service.
- **Synthesis Loader**:
    - `src.human_design.interpreter.transform_knowledge_base` now loads Human Design definitions from individual JSON files in `src/knowledge_graph/HDDefinitions/` instead of a monolithic `enginedef.json`.
    - Tests in `tests/synthesis/test_engine_definitions.py` were updated to use this new loading mechanism.
- **Kafka / KG Consumers**:
    - Corrected Kafka bootstrap server port in `services/kg/app/core/config.py` from `kafka:9093` to `kafka:9092` to match `docker-compose.yml`.
    - The `NameError: name 'json' is not defined` in consumers should be resolved as `import json` is present in both `chart_consumer.py` and `typology_consumer.py`. If it persists, it might be a very specific environment or reload issue.
- **Main API**:
    - Re-added `/` route to `main.py` for backward compatibility with tests, returning a simple status message. `/health` is the new primary health check.
    - Ensured `synthesis/engine.py` correctly imports `HD_KNOWLEDGE_BASE`. The "hd_interpreter global missing" error might relate to other modules or an older application structure if `main.py` was expected to provide it globally.
- **Rate-Limit Middleware**:
    - Updated `_rate_limit_check` in `src/routers/auth.py` to include `X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, and `X-RateLimit-Reset` headers in 429 responses, and to use the TTL for `Retry-After`.
- **Database Migrations**:
    - Created `entrypoint.sh` to run `alembic upgrade head` before starting the API service.
    - Updated `Dockerfile` to use `entrypoint.sh`.
    - Corrected `DATABASE_URL` in `docker-compose.yml` for the `api` service to use `postgresql+asyncpg` dialect, ensuring compatibility with `alembic/env.py`. This should resolve `no such table: user` errors if tests target the `api` service.
- **JSON Handling**:
    - Made `HDFeatureNode` instantiation in `chart_consumer.py` more robust by ensuring its `details` field is not an empty string (converts to `None`), preventing a `JSONDecodeError` from Pydantic's `Json` type.

### Changed
- Refined various test fixtures and mocks for stability and correctness, particularly for Kafka consumers and Human Design knowledge base loading.
